CubeRunner 2D

📌 Game Description

CubeRunner 2D is an infinite runner game where the player controls a cube, navigating through obstacles and collecting "orbz" to score points. The game features a unique mechanic where a ghost player on the left half of the screen mimics the player's movements with a delay, simulating network lag locally.


🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

The player runs automatically and must avoid obstacles while collecting orbz.

Hitting an obstacle reduces the player's health by 1.

Collecting an orb increases the score by 2.

The game tracks and stores the player's high score.

The ghost player on the left side follows the player's movement with a delay.

Difficulty increases over time as obstacles and orbz spawn more frequently and move faster.


🕹️ Controls

Tap anywhere on the right half of the screen to make the player jump.

This is the only control in the game.


🎨 Art Style & Visuals

The game features a neon-style aesthetic with glowing shaders.

Background scrolling, shockwave, and diffusion effects are implemented using Shader Graph.
